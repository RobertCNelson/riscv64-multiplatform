Subject: [PATCH 07/62] riscv: __asm_copy_to-from_user: Fix: fail on RV32

commit 22b5f16ffeff38938ad7420a2bfa3c281c36fd17 upstream.

Had a bug when converting bytes to bits when the cpu was rv32.

The a3 contains the number of bytes and multiple of 8
would be the bits. The LGREG is holding 2 for RV32 and 3 for
RV32, so to achieve multiple of 8 it must always be constant 3.
The 2 was mistakenly used for rv32.
